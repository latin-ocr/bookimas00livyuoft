NOTES, CHAPS. 22, 23. 109

tlaatss‘ The idea of saying in the gerund governs the following orat.
o liqna.

repetitum: L. S. ξ 97 ; S. G. ξ 543. Res repetere, technical word
for to “ sue for damages ; ’' res repetundae = ·‘ extortion.’' Aliquem
rerum repetundarum arquere, to accuse any one of extortion (lit. ⁴· of
property that must be recovered”). The whole speech would, in
oratio recta, be “Nos inviti quicquam, quod minus placeat Tullo,
dicemus, sed imperio subiqz'mur. Res repetitum venimus. Nz‘ red-
dentur bellum ‘indicere inssi summes*

§ 7. dimiserit: indirect question dependent on testes facere
(= calls the gods to witness).

expetant: the subject is di. “That upon that people the gods
may visit-,'' etc. Cp. xxiii. 4. It is possible that expetant is intran-
sitive; omnes clades will then be subject-“ that all the djsasters
of this war may fall upon that people.”

ch. 23. ξ 1. nuntiant domum : “carry this message home.”
L. S. ξ 113 ; S. G. ξ 260. Another example of pregnant construction
for the ordinary expression haec responsa domum reportant nuntiant-

αθ. C . xii. 3.
q ξ 2. προσ, . . . et: “ there was no pitched battle, and also '’ (nec = et
non .

§)3. plus quinque : for the omission of quam, cp. xviii. 2, and note.

circumdant : this verb admits of two constructions—(l) urbem.
fossa circumdare ; (2) urbi fossam circumdare.

ξ 4. dictatorem: “leader.¹¹ After the expulsion of the kings, the
name dictator was reserved in Rome for a sole general, elected in
times of great emergency, to Supersede both the consuls. It was in
reality a return to ihe monarchy, the only difference being that the
dictator could legally only hold office for six months. Like the king,
he possessed absolute power both within and without the walls, and
he was assisted by a Master of the Horse (Maqister Equitum).

ferox morte : cp. vii. 5‚ser0;z· viribus.

capite : ie. “ king.” expetiturum : see xxii. 7, note. In this
passage empcto is transitive.

past participle. Op. circumveniri, xxviii. 5, and the use of adire,
mare.

ξ 5. stativis ε sc. castris.

ducit : sc. copias. So with educit, ξ 6.

dimicent: subjunctive, because it is part of Tullus' orders, and
ῒέξῐθΐοτε of the envoy’s speech. So the following subjunctives in
t 's section.

ξ 6. si vana adferantur: “in case idle terms should be brought to
him‚’' i.e. “in case the matter were a ruse.'' The apodosis is suppressed
as in xv. 1, where see note.
