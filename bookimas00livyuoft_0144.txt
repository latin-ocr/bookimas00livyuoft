Latium. -ii, n. : the country of the Latini, lying on the west coast
of Italy, between the Tiber and the Sabines on the north, the Marsi

In the time of the kings this region was divided amongst several
small tribes, such as the Aequi, Hernici, Volsci (q.v.), and the Prisci
Latini, Aborigines, or Old Latins. The latter occupied thirty cities in
the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, chief amongst which was
Alba Longa. After Alba was rased by Tullus Hostilius, the Latini
were gradually reduced by successive kings, until the expulsion of
Tarquin the Arrogant gave them the opportunity of throwing off thc
yoke of Rome. They were finally conq uered at the close of the Latin
War, 338 B.c., and many of their towns received the full civitas, or
franchise, of Rome. The remainder became allied towns (socii), with
certain special privileges, and were known as the Nomen Latinum, in
which, however, were included many other colonies of Rome outside
Latium.
