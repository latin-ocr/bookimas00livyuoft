noras, enses. 39, 40. 123

cordi est: “is pleasant to ;'' lit. “is to the mind of.'’ Cordi is
predicative dative. † Most editions have esset, for which, however.
Madvig reads est, the reading followed in the translation, as the

. maxim is quite a general one. If esset be kept, evenit is perfect, and

quod causal. L. S. ξ 273.
iuvenis ε predicative—“ he turned out to be truly a youth of royal

character.”

§5- credere: verbs of hindcring usually take qum. L. S. ξ 244 ;
S. G. ξ 461 (1) ; but impedio, prohibeo, both admit also the simple
infinitive. Remember that hie tantus Itonos represents “such high
honour as this ” in English.

servisse: this accus, and infin. is the object ot credere. In the
following sentence the first qui refers to earam, and is subject of
ferunt, which controls the accus. and infin. clause umorem . . .
edidisse partum, as well as the oratio obliqua in the following section.

ξ 6. ut in domo : for this use of ut cp. xxxiv. 7.
ut . . . crederetur ε “ brought it about that he was thought to have

been born of a slave.'¹ venerit: the usual sequence would be venisset.

eh. 40. §2 pro indignissimo: this phrase is predicative to the
accus. and infin. clauses, which are the object of habuerant—“ though
they had considered most disgraceful the fact that they had been
expelled,” etc„ “and that there reigned at Rome,¹' etc.

non modo, . . . sed ne quidem: “not only not, . . . but not even.''
Non modo may be used for non modo mm, followed by ne . . . quidem,
provided that the predicate 01 other word is common to both clauses,
but stands with the latter. Here scirpis fulfils the required condition.

tum impensius : the construction changes, and continues independ-
ently of what has preceded. Such a case is known as an anacoluthon
(Gk. = non sequitur). 'rho regular syntax would be either (i) Anci
filii tum impensius indiqnabantm· (or indiqueri) ; or (ii) Anci filiis
duobus tum impensius crescebat (or erescere) indiqnitas. The infinitivo
is of course historic. Indiqnitas is here used in the unusual sense of
“indignation.” It commonly signifies “that which arouses indigna-
tion,” “an insult.” Imlifynor si is a construction borrowed from the
Greek, si standing for Latin ut. So miror η’. L. S. ξ 234, ΝΟΤΕ.

ξ 3. post centesimum: = centesimo fere anno postquam, etc. Cp.
xviii. 2 n. The following subjunctives are all put in the primary
rather than the historic tenses, for the sake of vivid effect, repre-
senting the fact as if present.

dedecus fore: sc. putabant. virili stirpe salvs ε abl. absolute.
In oratio recta we should have dedecus erit ιη’ . , . patet.

§4. rex . . . privatus: ⁴⁴ one who was a king, rather than one
who was a private citizen.’¹

delegisset : ‘³ whomsoever else he chose as his son-in-laW, he seemed
likely to make him also his heir.” The mood of deleqisset is due to
the suppressed hypothesis contained in facturus. In full it would
be eum heredem facturus erat, si quem delegisset ρεπεν-τινι.

ξ 5. quibus : ie. iis ferramentis quibus consueti erant. The clause
