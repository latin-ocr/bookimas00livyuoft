Q„

Quirinus, -i., m.: (1) the name by which Romulus was known after
his decease ; (2) an epithet of several gods and goddesseS, ay. Ianus.
Iuno, etc. It is derived from the same word as Quirite-s· (φα), and

Quirites, -ium, m. ε the title of the Romans in their civil capacity,
in full Populus Romanus Quiritium According to Livy and most
Roman writers, it was derived from Cures, being the name given to
the Sabines under Tatius, but afterwards extended to all the popula-
tion of the Roman hffls. It is perhaps derived from the Sabine word
quiris, a lance, and means simply the ‘⁵ warriors,” de. that part of
the populace which was fit for military service. Against this theory
it may be urged that in historic times Quirites was applied to
Romans in their civil, and not military capacity.

Romulus, -i, m.‚ and Remus, -i, m.: the twin sons of Rea Sylvia by
Mars. Numitor, father of Rea, was driven from Alba by his brother
Amulius, who seized the kingdom and made Rea a Vestal. She
became, however, mother of the twins, and was accordingly put to
death, while her children were cast on the Tiber in a trough. They
were finally stranded at a spot where grew a fig-tree, the Ficus
Ruminalis. Here they were suckled by a wolf, and found by Faustulus,
a shepherd, whose wife, Larentia, reared them. They slew Amulius,
restored their grandfather Numitor, and led out a band of Alban
colonists to the Palatine Hill. Romulus slew his brother in a fit of
anger, and became first and sole King of Rome. His reign is
commonly dated 753-715 B.C.
