nous, anps. 24, 25. 111

recta, is populus, ouius cives Ῐιοο certamine vicerint (fut. perf.)‚
alteri popula eum bona pace imperitate.

ξ 4. vetustior: by hypallage for vetustioris. We should say “ no
record of any older treaty.”

fetialis: there was at Rome a college οἱ twenty fetiales, whose
duties were concerned solely with the proper ratification of all treaties
and declarations of war. Deputations from their number were present
on all such occasions, under the head of one of their number, who
was elected president for the occasion, and styled Pater Patr-atus
(lit. “he who is made father '’). They carried with them certain
herbs, gathered on the Capitoline Hill (verbenae, or saqmina), and
their persons were sacred by the ius flentium (international law).

patre patrato : “ the chief herald of the Alban people.”

puram: sc. herbam, as in next line. tollito: the forms of the
future imperative are almost exclusively confined to archaic forms
of law and ritual.

Ἐξ 5. vasa: “ properties‚” i.e. the saqmz'rm, and the ffint-stone knife
o 9.

ἕ 6. fit : the word is out of place, belonging to pater patratus, its
complement. The real subject is Sp. Fusius.

effata: pa=sive‚ although from a deponent verb. Carmen is any
religious formula, whether in verse or not.

operae : L. S. ξ 144 ; S. G. ξ 297. Lit. “is not for a task,“ τῖε. “is
not worth the trouble.''

ξ 7. populus Albanus: observe the archaic uae of the nominative
for the vocative.

prima postrema: ellipse of et, “from first to last.'’ So in ξ 8,
consilio (et) dolo.

ξ 8. defexit: the corresponding form in the simple verb is sa rit,
which is made up of fac-‚ the stem of facere, ÷-8-, the tense ending
(whence the tense is termed an 3 aorist)‚÷¹it (cp. sit, the 3rd sing.
pres. subj. of esse). See note on adclarassis, ch. xviii. 9. Faarit,
when compounded with de, changes a to e, on account of the accent
having originally fallen on the prefix (fascic, de'feoeit).

Diespiter: an old title of Jupiter, = Father ot Light (dies, pater).
The use of ille (= “the great '’) with the second person as here is
unusual. It is common with the third person.

ch. 25. ξ 1. convenerat: impersonal‚ ‘⁸ as had been arranged.”
utrosque: see on xxiii. 9. The following oratio obliqua depends
on adhortarentur = “ say in exhortation.”
civium: L. ἃς 141; S. G. ξ 270. quidquid, like the preceding
accusatives, is subject to intueri, to which arma, . . . manns are objects.
ξ 2. agebatur: ‘⁶ was being treated of,” i.e. ‘· was at stake.’'
ξ 3. terni: ‘⁴ three from each side.''
fecissent: subjunctive after quam ( =qualem). L. S. §2833 S. G.
‚5'479“ Cp. xxi. l, note on ea. In direct speech ea erit . . . quam
eoertmus.
