8 Lu‘Y 1.

Rome from her foundation to the time of Augustus was
no light task, and Livy had intended to complete it in
fifteen parts, of ten books each, or a total of 150 books.
It is prohable that the last eight books were never written.

As yet, History was a crude subject with the Romans.
Thus far it had been recorded mainly as Fasti, that is,
year-by-year records of the electionS, names of the consuls,
religious matters, and the principal events of national
importance. Traces of this survive in Livy's arrangement
of his History by years, a habit which continues even down
to Tacitus' time, at the end of the first century ΑΛ). It
must be remembered that dates were fixed by the names of
the consuls, and that there was no other recognized method
of keeping count of time.

Livy was no critic. He compiled his work freely from
various sourceS‚ including almost all previous annalists.
He omitted what he chose to regard as needless, and in
accordanee with the Roman custom, he rarely mentions his
authority for a borrowed passage, as in xlv„ ξ 2. Very
rarely, too, does he raise alternative views, as in the case of
the eost of the Capitoline Temple, lv„ ξ 7.

He did not care to verify by persona] observation difficul-
ties of geography. Nor was he an antiquat-ian, though the
monuments of a nation are amongst the surest and most
essentia] data of its history.

His aim was to give, without exeess of detail and with no
systematis: criticism, the annales and legends of Rome from
first to last as a readable whole. In this he certainly
succeeded, and his work remained, to Rome's latest days,
one of the books of the nation. But he was a poet and a
raconteur rather than a writer of history, anfi he cares
more for polished style and taking passages than for aceu-
racy of detail and scientific continuity.

ξ 2. The Authorities and Credibility of Livy.-In the
year 390 B.c. the Gauls sacked and bui-ned Rome, and in
doing so destroyed most, if not all, written authorities for
the years preceding that date. These authorities could not
have been very copious‚ for it was not until many years
later that anything like a yearly history of events was
made; and still less could they have been reliable for any
