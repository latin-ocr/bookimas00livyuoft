noras, anPs. 35-37. 121

58. The circus Maximus lay in the Vallis Murcia, between the
Aventine and Palatine Hills.

ubi: final ; hence the mood of facerent, ‘² In order that there they
might make themselves seats.'' L. S. ξ 277 ; S. G. ξ 478.

spectacula: “a place for watching,” “seats ;'' an unusual sense
of the word.

§9. spectavere: “they looked on, props supporting the benches
at a height of twelve feet each from the ground.’' duodeni: the
distributive implies that the same height was observed in each case.

ξ 10. privatis: dative of recipient with divisa. Aedificanda is
merely predicative, “to be built upon.'‘

ch. 36. ξ 1. posset: the subjunctive is used by Livy after prius-
quam, although there is no notion of purpose ; cp. note on dimicarent
xxiv. 3.

§3. neque mutari neque constitui: observe that after a negative
word such as nullus, nunquam, nesle, ‘⁶ either . . . or '’ is expressed
by neque . . . aequm and in these cases such subsequent negatives
do not affcct the sense. Cp. xxvi. 12, note.

aves z “ birds²¹ or ‘⁶ ome11s.”

ξ 4. agedum: when thus appended to an imperative, dvm is a
mere particle ot' emphasis, with no meaning of its own. So aqite
dum.

possit: subjunctive of indircot question, marked by -ne (ε whether).

ξ 5. comitio: remember that in the singular this word means the
place in which the elections (comitia, pl.) were held. It was, in
early times, to the north of the Forum, between that, the Capitoline
Hssl, and the Senate-house (Curia).

summa rerum: “most important matters.'’ Summa is the neut.
pl. of the superlative, used substantively. Cicero would say summae
res.

ξ 7. alterum tantum: lit. “ another so-much,” tle. ‘⁸ as many again.'’
The number of 1,800, which Livy gives as the total of the equites,
appears inconsistent with his previous statements. In i. 13 he says
that Romulus instituted three centuries of equites, in i. 30 that
Tullus Hostilius added ten more (supposed to be equal to 300 more).
This gives 600 equites. If, then, Tarquinius doubled this number, the
total would be 1‚200, not 1,800.

eh. 37. ξ 1. missis: sc. hominibus. The following qui is final.
L. S. ξ 278; S. G. § 478.

in ratibus ι “ being on rafts.” The logs were piled on rafts‚ fired,
and allowed to drist against the piles (sublici-3) of the bridge which
the Sabines had thrown over the Anio.

† The text has been emended by appending que to sublicis. In
ratibus will then go with impacta, and will stand in its usual sense,
“jammed amongst the boats and piles.'’ The bridge is, with this
reading, supposed to be partly of boats, partly of piles.
