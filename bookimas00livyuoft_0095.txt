§6. vastae: vastus» is the same word as “wasta'’ and does not
mean ‘⁴ vast,’' ‘⁴ huge.”

“the story holds, that . . .’' The expression = ferunt, and governs
the orat. obliqua down to invenerit.

occurs because the parenthesis is one personally introduced by Livy.

See Introduction. It is here used = Lupercalia, the annual festival

from Pales, a god (or goddess) of the flocks, itself ultimately from
the root pa, to protect, nourish.
