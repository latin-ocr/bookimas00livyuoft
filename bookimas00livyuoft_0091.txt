sorus, CHAP. 1. 87

= “a tendency to indulgence.” Perdo is used as the aetive voice
of pereo, which is intransitive, “to go to ruin.” The genitives are
objective, as deorum dearumque below.

absint: jussive subjunctive. necessariae erunt: Livy commonly
uses forsitan (as if it werefortasse) with the indicative, though in
Cicero it takes subjunctive.

ξ 13. ut . . . darent: the subjunctive is final, and the subordinate
clause stands as object to the ,verbal notion implied in precationibus.
Verbs of. asking admit two accusatives (L. S. ξ 35; S. G. ξ 243),
and the corresponding nouns may take both a genitive of the person
asked and an object clause of the thing asked for.

orsis: neut. plur. participle used as noun, to which operis stands
as defining genitive. tantum : ‘³ only,'’ goes with orsis.

eh. 1. §L constat: on this verb depends all the construction
(accus. and infinitive) to the end of ξ 4. The various verbs of the
minor clauses—suerunt, quaerebant, ete—are in the indicative, as
expressing the remarks of Livy pmonally, and not an integral part
of the “general belief ‘’ (id quod constabat). L. S. ξ 309, NOTE 2 ;
S. G. 467, Ohs.

saeffiitum esse: lit. “that it was cruelly raged against;¹' saei-[0
being an intransitive verb, can only be constructed impersonally in
the passive voice. In such cases the object, if any, is constructed
exactly as with the active verb, but is usually turned into the subject
of the English translation. L. S. ἓ 60; S. G. ξ 120.

duobus: dative after abstinuisse. L. S. 42; S. G. ξ 292, Obs. 2.
This verb is more commonly used intransitively = to resrain from,
when it is followed by the simple ablative. L. S. ξ 52.

§3. et in quem: the whole of this sentence is parenthetic‚ ie.
independent of the orat. obliqua introduced by constat, and is there-
fore expressed in the indicative mood. The subject to voc-atur is of
course loeus, which is transferred into the relative clause by a
common idiom.

Troiano: the English sentence, “The boy whose name is Iulus,'’
may in Latin be rendered in one of three ways: (1) puer cui nunc
caynomen Iulo (dat.), where the predicative noun is attracted to the
case of the relative. L. S. §1473 S. G. ξ 296, Obs. This is the
construction exemplified in Troiana, and is the most idiomatic.
(2) puer cui mum coynosmen Ivlzm, where the predicative noun is in
3333-'313205335320 imit, 2251· 3¹35.⁵310}ss355..³¹2.³.53‘²‡}.¹355¹30.¹5.2¹.2232
Iuli (gen). This is unusual, and not to be imitated.

appellati : sc. sunt. For the number see L. S. ξ 11, NOTE 2 ; S. G.
ξ 222. lt may be remarked, once and for all, that the ellipse of the
third persons of the present indicative of swm, and the present infini-
tive, whether used as auxiliaries οι· otherwise, constantly occurs in
prose narrative.

ξ 4. ab simili clade: Cicero would have omitted the preposition,
but it is by no means rare in Livy with ablatives of cause,
