qui . . . qui: for uter . . . uter. The use of the interrogative
adjective (qui, quae, qnod) in lieu of the interrogative pronoun
(quie, quae, quid), and vice vermi, is not uncommon. Its use for uter
is much less frequent.

daret . . . regeret: “who was to give, . . . who was to rule.''
We should have expected dare deberet or quem dare oporteret. Cp.
Livy XXI. 44. 5, includit ⁷208 terminis quos non eoecedamus (“ which
we are not to transgress”).

templa: “stations ς ” sacred spots, marked out with religious
formulae, from which to watch for augural signs, which were usually
taken from the fiight of birds, or from natural phenomeua‚ such as
thunder and lightning.

Gh- 7. ξ 1. vultures : in apposition with ausfur-ium, the subject of
fertur. Remember that the English sentence, “ It is said that Caesar
has crossed the Rubicon‚'' becomes in Latin Caesar Rubiconem traie-
cisse dicitur (not dicitnr Caesarem).

regem: “each as king‚” primary oblique predicate. It is primary
because predicated directly of the subject (utrumque), oblique because
that subject is an oblique case.

praecepto: lit. “on the ground of the time forestalled,” i.e. “on
the ground of the priority of time.“ The followers of Remus claimed
the kingship for him because he was the first to see any birds.
Those of Romulus claimed it because Romulus had seen the greater
number. Both ablatives are those of cause.

fama est ε with accus, and infin„ it being equal to a verb declarandi.

sic deinde: sc. pereat.

§3. sacra . . . facit: “offered sacrifice.” The phrase is usually
constructed, as here, with a dative of the person to whom the sacrifice
is made ; it may also take an ablative of the victim sacrificed, as in
ξ 12, below. Facere is frequently used in the same sense, without
sacrum.

Graeco : sc. ritu. It is not to be taken as dative with Herculi.

ξ 4. memorant : the verb governs both abestis-se and procubuisse.

qua. : sc. υἰᾶ (ablative of the road by which).

laeto ε “luxuriant ;'' and so regularly when applied to plants and
trees.

§5. viribus: causal ablative with fcrooe. “ Emboldened by his
stren th.’‘

dedguctura erant = deduxissent. The future participle with eram,
fueram, etc„ may take the place of the pluperfect subjunctive in the
apodosis of a hypothetical sentence.

quemque: in apposition with boves. The cattle are spoken of as
oscen in Sthis§s{z;ntence. In the remainder of the story they are always
cozes. ee .
