prose is very sparing ot* the use of the plural of abstract nounS, while
it is common in Livy.

and uncle (z a quibus), viii. 3.

ξ 2. ipsi z ‘⁴ on their own account.'’

§3. nomen Caeninum: “the tribe of the Caeninenses‚’‘ im. “all
who bore the name of Caeninenses.’‘ Cp. Nomen Latinum.

§4 vastantibus: sc. eis. A dative always follows obviam ire,
obrias esse, fleri, venire, etc.

exercitu victore: “ his victorious army.'' This use of substantives
in apposition, instead of adjectives, is more frequent in Livy than in
Cicero or Caesar, and still more frequent in Tacitus (6.9. Imperator
populus, the imperial people).

ξ 5. cum factis : see viii. 2, note.

finis z cp. sommum, ix. 6.

cognomen: “ tit1e‚’' zle. that of Feretrius (from fero), ‘⁶ the Spoil
bearer.”

sedem ε appositive to templum.

ξ 7. haec: observe the attraction of the prononn, which refers to
the whole previous sentence. from the neuter gender to that of the

bina: the distributive is used in lieu of the ordinal number, because
spolia is not used in this sense in the singular. L. S. ξ 187; S. G.
ξ 70, note. The remaining two occasions on which the spolia opima
were acquired were in 426 B.c., by Cornelius Cossus, who slew Tolum-
nius, King of Veii, and in 222 B.c., when Marcellus slew Viridomarus,
a Gaulish king.

eh. 11. ξ 1. per occasionem et solitudinem : lit. “through the

oppressit: “ overtook.'’

ξ 2. ovantem ε in later times an ovation signified a minor triumph,
in which the victorious general entered the city on toot, clad in the
