noras, CHAP. 8. 95

ξ 2. ita . . . sic : in this way, ie. “only on condition that.”

cum . . . tum: “both . . . and.'’ This idiom is very common in
Livy, and especially with the ablative, as here. Care must be taken
to distinguish this conjunctive cum from the preposition. Cp. x. 5,
eto·

lictoribus: the twelve lictors constituted the consul’s guard of
honour in later days. They carried the faeces (bundles of rods,
υἱνριιε, and axes, seeurex), which symbolized his power of inflicting
both chastisement and death—civil and military penalties.

ξ 3. sententiae: L. S ξ 1423 S. G. ξ 265. eorum: possessive
genitive, antecedent to quihus. The latter worl depends on placet
(impersonal). L. S. ξ 42; S. G. ξ 291, ὃ. The two accusative
clauses, apparitores (ductos esse), 'numerum ductum (esse), are the
real subjects to the impersonal verb, quibus placet ( = qni putant).

hoc genus: accusative of description, used to quality apparitores.
N ormal prose usage has ablative or genitive (huius generis).

sella curulis: the curule chair, ot ivory, was the badge of Patrician
magistraeies only, such as (originally) the consulship, censorship,
dictatorship, and praetorship, which were hence called curule offices.

praetexta: the “bordered'' toga (prae, team, embroidered in
front) was worn by magistrates, and by the sons of nobles until the
age for assuming the toqa virilis, the ordinary unornamcnted white
gown. The praeteoeta was of white wool, bordered with purple, and
was called laticlaviam or anqusticzaz-ium, according as the border
was broad (latus) or narrow (arzqastus).

singulos singuli. ‘one lictor apiece.” The use of sinquli is
redundant, and the word need not be translated.

(54. hominum. partitive genitive, depending on id. L. S. ξ 141,
NOTE 2 ; S. G. 270. It is, as commonly, attracted from the antecedent
clause to that of the consequent (ad z'd hominum quod tam erat). Id
is here a substantive. Translate—“as they were fortifying it in the
hope of the population that was to be rather than with a view to
that number of inhabitants which existed at the time.”

ξ 5. causa: ablative, “for the sake of,'' a very common quasi-
prepositional use with the genitive. So qratia in the same sense.

natam: predicate to prolem. sibi: a kind of ethic dative. L. S.
ξ 143, ΝΟΤΕ 3,· S. G. g 290. Most ancient peoples of Greece and Italy
boasted that they were autochthonous, or indigenous, or aborigines—
all of which words si gnify ‘born of the soil on which they dweltss’

Such a belief was held as a guarantee of importance.
qui nunc, etc.- “the spot which is now shut in as you descend

(from the Ca pitol) between two groves. ’ Βθεσεηᾱετιίὶὔηε is a dative
of reference, the noun being indefinite, and therefore suppressed (lit.
“ to (men) coming down ”).

asylum: a Greek word, meaning ‘⁴ inviolable. ” It is here con
structed as secondary predicate to locum.

ξ 6. esset: subjunctive of indirect question, depending on the
noun discr' zmine, as if the Latin were nee eoequc'r ebant. Before liber,

utrum is omitted.
