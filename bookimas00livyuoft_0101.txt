norm, anps. 9, 10. 97

ξ 10. eo : the adverb, “occupied in that direction.⁷’ More usual
would have been εἰ. (sc. spectacula). Cp. ν. 3, huic deditis ludicro.

ex composito ε substantival, ‘· by prearrangenientss’

ξ 11. in quem: the antecedent (suppressed) is ab eo: “by him
into whose hands she had fallen.”

ex plebe : qualifying homines, ‘⁴ men of the lower orde1·.''

domos : L. S. ξ 113 ; S. G. ξ 260. deferebant : “began to carry
off.'' Notice this use of the imperfect.

ξ 12. ferunt: (“ they say '') governs the orat. obliqua throughout

ὼὲεξίἓὲἓῗᾞ. S. ξ 311; S. G. ξ 468. In orat. recta the word was

fertis?

Quis, the indefinite pronoun or adjective, is admissible in statements
or eommmds, only after ne, si, nisi ‚· in questions, eequis or numquis.

clamitatum: see i. 1, on saevitum.

vocem: ‘⁴ cry.” Talassio (or 'l‘alassiuao was the cry of the guests
who escorted to her husband's house a Roman bride. What Livy
says of its origin is of course a fabie, as probably is the whole story
of the rape of the Sabine women. The real origin of the cry is
unknown.

§13. incusantes: “complaining of the engagement (bond) of a
hospitality that was outraged;'‘ another instance of hypallage,
Violati being for violatum. Cp. i. 4 n.

per fas ac fidem: “on the score of divine right and (men's) pro-
miseS.” To do violence during a sacred festival was sacrilege, not to
mention that it broke the understood guarantee of peace on the part

of those who gave the festival.

ς 14. ipse : “ in person.'’ The word must often be translated by a
periphrasis, eg. ipse vide, I saw with mine own eyes ; ipse interfeci,
Ι slew him with my own hand, etc. patrum : their fathers.

negassent: the qui is causal (L. S. ξ 2ῖ3ς S. G. ξ 477), but the
mood would in any case be subjunctive. as the whole of this and the
next section are in orat. obliqua. The controlling verb must be
supplied. Cp. ξ 2, note on urbes.

what one once had, or the want of that which one ought to have.

in lieu of the genitive (raptarum) is especially frequent in Livy.
Cp. v. 6, Numitori.
