130 LIVY 1.

ξ 5. bonis multare : “fine them in goods.’‘ The ablative is one of
price. L. S. ξ 112 ; S. G. (5316. causam: pretext.

unde : = eos, α quibus. The conjunction is generic, and hence the
mood of posset. L. S. ξ 283 ἠς S. G. ξ 482.

ξ 6. per se ι “ by their agench’ The reflexive refers not to Ταν-
quinius, but to patres. cum quibus : cp. xlv, 2.

§9. ab Ulixe: oriundus is followed by ab when remote descent
is indicated, otherwise the ablative only.

nuptum t the supine is regularly used in this phrase, though other-
wise restricted to verbs implying motion.

ch. 50. ξ 1. esse quae: sc. dia-it. frequentes: notice that this
word and its cognates rarely mean “frequent,’¹ etc„ but commonly
signify, as here, ‘⁴ in crowds.'‘ Notice‚ too, that dies is feminine in this
seotion, masculine in the next. The usual distinction made between
the two usages is that (1) dies, masculine, means a particular day:
(2) dies, feminine, = ‘⁴ a time‚’' ‘⁴ season‚” as we say “a day will
come when‚'' etc.

ξ 3. ab Aricia: cp. ab Corintho, xlvii. 4 n.

an: when used to introduce a direct question, this particle implies
that the opposite of it would be absurd. Notice the use of esse,
apparere, portendi, to express rhetorical questions in first or third
persons in oratio obliqua (L. S. ξ 312; S. G. ξ 469), and the vivid
use of the primary tenses of the subjunction‚ in lieu of the historio
(acceperint, premat, etc).

ξ 5. crediderint: “entriisted.''

ξ 6. exulatum: cp. xli. 7 ; lx. 2.

si se audiant: in oratio recta.3i me audiatis, domum suam quisque
abeatis, etc. L. S. ξ 250 (a) ς S. G. ξ 426.

ξ 7. cum maxime ι “ just at the moment when.”

ξ 8. id temporis: “at such a time‚” tle. so late. L. S. ξ 134, n. 2 ς S. G.
ξ 270. For other phrases in which the acc., and not the abl„ is used
to express time when, cp. id aetatis, hoc noetis. The mood of venisset
is due to the preceding subjunctive, pnrqaret, by attraction.

ξ) 9. tulisse: “he did not obtain even this from Turnus without
remark, for (Turnus) said‚” etc. Notice the abrupt change of subject,
and also the use of zacritus in a passive sense (= left in peace).
Usually it is active, ‘⁶ peaceful.''

infortunium : “he would get into trouble.” The phrase is colloquial
and vulgar.

ch. 51. ξ 1. pro imperio: “by virtue of his (Tarquin's) authority.”
He had no right to punish a Latin.

ξ 2. sineret: ut is to be understood after eorrupit. Some editions
insert it. vim magnam: “a large numbers

ξ 4. The construction is oblique down to the end of ξ 6. auctor
concilii is “he who was responsible for the convocation,'’ λε. Tarquin.
Notice the free use of primary for historic sequence. aggressurum
fuisse t the protasis is suppressed (8.9. si potuisset).
