more co-ordinate words must either (1) all or (2) none have et (·que,
etc.). In this case the words are a religious formula, and faustum

eliz constitute one idea, which is connected by -qne with the co-
ordinate idea in bonwm. Cp. xvii. 10; L. S. ξ 208; and S. G. ξ 444.

junctives, starent . . . pervaqarentur, depend on ‘ut consecutive, and
