122 mvv 1.

§ 2. quoque : te. the burning of the bridge, as well as the increase
in the numbers of the Romans.

ad urbem ε to be taken with fluitantia. Insiqnem is the secondary
predicate tofeoere.

ξ 3. ferunt: sc. quidam, “men say.’' Notice that curro, in com-
pounds, usually drops the reduplication of the perfect, like pello.
Decvrro, however, retains it.

instantes : accusative.

ξ 4. petebant : “ tried to seek, make for.’'

§ 5. male gestae ς “though they had been defeated‚” the regular
phrase.

ξ 6. gesturos ι sc. se.

tumultuario ε “ levied in a hurry‚'’ and so “ undisciplined.”

ch. 38. ξ 1. eamque : “the following,’ ‘⁶ as follows-'⁸

ξ 2. oratores : cp. XV. 5 n. The tense of dederatis is due to that
of missi, which is an aorist perfect, ‘⁴ who were sent.”

in sua potestate: “its own master,” i.e. acting on its own free
will. The phrase = sui potens, xxxv. 4.

ξ 4. universae rei ε “ a battle of their whole forces‚” i.e. one
decisive battle. Ubi is here = et ibi, just as qui, etc. = et τὶς, etc.

aut qui : the antecedent (cle eis populis) is suppressed.

ξ 6. cloacis : “ he drained by sewers conducted with a slope
(sastiqz'o) to the Tiber.” Fastz‘qz‘vm properly means “an elevation,''
and hence “an angle of elevation,” “slope” The Cloaea Maoeima,
still extant⁷ was the chief of these sewers‚ which to this day drain
Rome in all directions.

† Some editions insert e before fastiqz’o, = from higher ground.

ξ 7. ad aedem: “ for a temple.'' The dative would be more usual.

ch. 39. ξ 1. puero z dative equivalent to a genitive after caput.

Servio: for the case cp. i. 3.

ξ 2. reges ε τῖε. reqem et reginam.

familiarium : ‘⁶ slaves.’¹ The word originally = famulus ,· and the
original sense of familia is not ⁴⁴ family ‘⁷ (of relatives), but “ house-
hold'’ (of slaves, etc), “establishment.‘’ The construction is still
oratio obliqua after serunt, retentum (esse), being a principal verb
like vetuisse. To the latter verb, however, the subject is reqinam
understood.

ξ3. secretum: sc.. lomam. Videnz :videsnff a common con·
traction in poetry. So audin ἲ adn? (= audisne? aisne ?).

scire licet: usually written in the contracted form scilicet, “ of
course‚'' “any one can see that.'’

quondam : “some day.'’ Like olim, this word is usually used of
past time. It occurs, however, occasionally as here.

ξ 4. coeptum haberi : impersonally. The true subject is the clause
puerum haberi, ete. When coupled with a passive infin. coepi
always becomes coeptus sum, etc. liberum} cp. ix. 15.
