INTRoDUCTION. 13

introduced in order to find a means of utilizing the growing
number of plebeians. Livy says that there were six classes,
not including the equites, and that the income of each
class was fixed at not less than 100‚000 eopper asses
for the first, 75‚000 for the second, 50,000 for the third,
25‚000 for the fourth, and 11,000 for the fifth, the sixth
included all who had less property than 11‚000 asses. Each
class was divided into two divisions of ›S'eniores and Juniores,
and each division contained an equal number of centuriae„
which varied according as the classis was richer or poorer.
Thus the first class contained forty centul-ies of seniors, and
forty of juniors3 the second contained only twenty in all, as
did the third and fourth 3 the fifth classis contained thirty
centuries. There were, besides, two centul-ies of sappers
(fabri), three of supernumeraries (accensi), i.e., trumpeters,
etc., and eighteen of equites. The grand total was there-
fore 193 centuries. Each century had one vote, and there-
fore the first class, together with the equites, who voted
with them, contained ninety-eight votes in all, or more
than half the entire poll. Thus the chief power was put
into the hands of the rich. The equites included the
Sex Suffrayia, already mentioned, and also twelve new
centuries, who were provided with horses by the State, and
were hence called equites equo publico.

The entire classification was made in accordance with a
census, or registration of property 3 and to make this census
more easily, the populace were divided into four payi, or
city tribes—the Palatine‚ Esquiline, Suburran, and Oolline.
In after times this number was increased to thirty-five in
all, by the addition of other paqi, or tribes, beyond the
walls. These had nothing to do with the older tribes of the
Ramnenses, Tities, and Luceres, which had no political purpose.

The kings seem to have had, as a rule, no assistants, but

they could, when they chose, appoint Quaestores (trackers),
to make special inquiries as, αφ, 111 cases of murder
parricidii) or treason (perduellionis). These were not
permanent magistrates. There was, however, a Prefectus
Urbis, who may have been a permanent officer under the
later kings He acted as the king’s representative in the
city when the latter was absent in war.
