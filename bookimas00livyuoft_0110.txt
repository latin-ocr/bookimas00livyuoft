106 LIVY 1.

oh. 19. ξ 1. eam: redundant, ἵζε. as urbem novam is the gram-
matical object of candere, the insertion oi eam is needless.

§2 quippe eflerari: “since (he thought that) men‘s tempers
were ensavaged by warfare.’' The construction is orat. obliqua, the
governing verb being understood from fideret. Other readings are
efferos (sc, esse) 3 efferatis animis ,· efferatos (se. esse) animos

Ianum : “a temple of Janus‚ at the foot of the Argiletum.” The
name of this god was commonly used t'or the fuller form Templum
Iani, especially when, in later times, most of the money-changing
business centred about the three arcus Iani. Hence Arous Iam‘, or
Ianus, = a bank. The Arqizetum was a slope to the north-east of
the Forum, said to have been the scene of the death ot* Argus, the
son of an augur, who was killed for disclosing some myster-ies· (Arqz‘
letum). The name probably really means “ the clayey ground,‘' from
argilla, white clay.

ξ 3. clausus fuit : “ has been for some time closed; ” not the same
as clausus est, “has been closed (whether for a shorter or longer
time).'’ The former denotes a state, the latter an act, in the past.

Τ. Manlio consule: L. S. §83; S. G. ξ 334. He was consu] in
235 B.O., six years after the first Punic war (264-241 B.c.).

bellum Actiacum: the “war of Actium'’ was so called from the
battle of Actium, which ended it, 31 B.0.‚ when Octavius afterwards
known as Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome, finally defeated
Antonius assisted by Cleopatra. Actium is at the mouth of the
Gulf of Ambracia, on the Promontory of Leucas, south of Corcyra,
on the west coast of Central Greece. Augustus closed the Temple of
Janus on his return to Rome, 29 ΒΩ. quod nostrae: the relative
refers to the clause claususfuz‘t iterum post bellum, etc.

ξ 4. rem, etc. : in apposition with the words deorum metum inicere.

55. commento: perf. part. of comminiscor used substantivally.
Upon it depends miraculi “without some fiction of a miracle.¹'

essent: after quae in a consecutive sense—‘⁶ such as were.” L. S.

§6. ad cursus: “according to the courses of the moon.” The
year was divided into twelve lunar months. But a lunar year con-
tains roughly only 12 >< 2932, or 354 days; so that in a very little
while the calendar date and the real (solar) date would be very
widely different. Numa therefore inserted an intercalary mouth, in
such a manner that the close of twenty lunar years should coincide
with that of twenty solar years, aud every twenty-first year com-
mence at the true moment. [The calendar remained unaltered
until Julius Caesar, in 45 B.c.‚ reformed it as we now have it. By
that time the error which remained in Numa's system—the true
lunar month being a fraction more than 293 days—aided by various
other causes, had accumulated to some months]

ad metam congruerent: “coincided with that starting-point of
the sun from which they had begun, while every year had its full
course.” The meta is properly the turning-post in a racc-course, or
the goal. It was also used, as here, for the starting-post (carceres).
