112 LIVY 1.

ξ 4. spectantis : accusative. Cp. solemnis, ix. 6. neutro : “to
neither side.'⁷

ξ 5. spectaculo: dative of result. L. S. ξ 144 ; S. G. ς 297.

ξ 6. vice : “ half-dead by reason of the condition of the one man.''
There is an easier reading, vicem (adverbially), ‘⁴ on behalt' of.'’

ξ 7. integer ι “ untouched,’' the primary meaning of the word.

ut . . . sic: this pair of correlatives may usually be rendered by
translating me ‘⁴ while,'' and omitting 3⁹20 ; or by “though . . . yet.'’

ᾧ 8. sequentes . . . abesse : videt here has two constructions: (1)
the simple object-accusative ; (2) accusative and infinitive. Maqnis
interuallis, model ablative. Α

ξ 9. ex insperato z “after an unexpected event.” Faventes=
fautores, the “supportem'’ of combatants. solet: so. esse, which is
commonly omitted with this verb.

ξ 10. alter ι the dual word is used because only two of the Curiatii
now remained. We should say “ the third,'‘ and “the second
(alterum).’' posset: after prius quam final. See xiv. 4, note on
esset. nec procul : nec = uon is an archaism.

ξ 11. Marte: the name of the god is commonly used for that of
which he is the personification. So Venus = love, Vulcanus = fire,
Iuppiter = the sky.

ξ 12. fratrum : sc. meorum. Possessive genitive with Manibus.

sustinenti : dative of disadvantage.

§13. eo . . . quo: “ in proportion as.” This phrase is only used
with comparatives in both clauses, so that with prope must be
supplied maqis.

dicionis alienae : cp. tutelae, vi. 4.

oh. 26. ξ 1. ex foedere: cp. em consilio, ix. 2.

usurum . . . foret: orat. obliqua after imperat = “he said in his
orders,’'

ξ 2. princeps : predicative‚ as in xii. 5.

Capena: “the Capuan Gate‚’' near the south-east foot of the
Palatine Hssl, through which ran the Via Appia southward, through
Latium and Campania to Capua, the chief town of the latter division
of Italy.

paludamentum: in later times this signified the official mantle of
the consul as commander of the armies, and which therefore he was
not allowed to wear within the city, excepting on the occasion of his
first leaving it to assume the command. Nothing military had any
place within the walls of Rome, except in such a crisis as required
dictatorial powers. ss'ee note on xxiv. 9.

ξ 4. inmaturo: properly “unripe,” and so “out of place‚” ‘⁴ un·
seasonable.'’

ξ 5. facinus : (fiomfaoz'o) = any deed‚ whether good or bad. Scelus
==a crime. Ftaqitz· u m ε a disgraceful offence. Nefa8=a sin. Delict-
um = a misdemeanor (in law). Crimen = a charge.

meritum: “ service‚” “ a deed which has merit '‘ (laus).
