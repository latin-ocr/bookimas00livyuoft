ΝΟΤΕΞ, OHAP. 18. 105

comparatives. In affirmative sentences, as here, it can only be used
to imply that only the very rarest individuale, occurred. In ξ 3,
below, the question renders the sentence quasi-negative, = “no one
would have been roused by any intercourse of language.”

iuris: L. S. ξ 40 ; S. G. ξ 276, 2.

§2- centum amplius: in the full and correct form the sentence
would run, amplius quam centum annis post (adverb). The omission
of quam is idiomatic with numerals after plus, amplius, minus. The
accusative annos is due to the adverb post, which became misplaced
so as to precede anuis, and was then taken as a preposffion, to accord
with which annis was altered to annos.

ξ 3. eiusdem aetatis : ‘⁴ of the same date.” fuisset: L. S. ξ 261 ;
S. Gr. §§ 427, 503. The apodosis is quae fama (pervenisset) ? Some
editions have qua for quae. “By what report did P. rcach the
Sabines 2 ”

quemquam: see above, § 1, note.

ξ 4. suopte: S. G. ξ 79, θῦε. 2.

virtutibus: dependent on temperatum, ‘⁶ that his mind was regu·
lated by virtue.''

ξ 5. inde : cp. unde, viii. 3.

quisquam : sc. ausus est.

ad unum: ‘⁴ to a man.‘'

§6. augurato : a participle standing alone in ablative absolute.
So auspicato, “ after consulting the auspices ;'’ compecto (oompaoz'seor).
“by arrangement; ” and with adjectives, serena, “ in fine weather.'’
Translate—“ with due auguries.” Urbe condenda, an ablative of date,
like morte, xxii. 1.

honoris ergo: “by way of compliment.” This use of erqo as a
preposition is archaic and unusual.

deductus: “ escorted‚''the regular word. It does not necessarily
mean to “lead down.’'

§7- ab oriente ad occasum: the words sole, solis must be under-
stood with the participle and the noun respectively. The augur,
seated on the left of Numa, faced the east. He then marked out
(determinavit) an imaginary line from the eastern horizon to his
own position, and a second line intersecting this at right angles.
He thus had four districts (reqiones), those to the north of the first
line being on his left, those to the south on his right. He then
determined in his mind upon a sign which was to appear ‘⁶ opposite
to him, at the utmost extent of his eyesight'' (eontra, quoad, etc.).
After a prayer, he stated aloud what he wished the sign to be, and
on its appearance declared that the gods approved of Numa as King
of Rome.

ξ 9. uti: for the commoner form utinam.

adclarassis: 2nd sing. of an aorist (τῖε. past) tense of the sub-
junctive, consisting os adelam„ the stem of the verb adclarare,
-†- -8(i)s-‚ the tense ending (whence the form is called a sis aorist),
-Ι- -is, the personal ending (cp. sis, the 2nd sing. pres. subj. of esse).

templo : “ sacred place.” Cp. vi. 4.
