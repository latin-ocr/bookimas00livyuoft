corresponded to the patricii of Rome. Tarquiniis : L. S. ξ 122 ; S. G.
ξ 257. Honoris “ rank,“ or ‘⁶ magistracy.”

ibi quoque : πλε. 111 Tarquinii, as well as in Rome, he was an alien.

ξ 2. Corinthii: a native of Corinth, on the isthmus of that name.
Roman legends recorded a lively intimacy between that town and
Etruria in early days, and from thence were said to have come all
the great artists of Etruria.

ducta: “ married.'’ Ducere mem-em is said of the husband, nubere
of the wife.

ξ 3. filio t πλε. Α1111115. The dative follows superne-5, on the analogy
of that after supersum.

ventrem ferre ε = qravidam esse. testando: “ in making his will.”
This absolute use os testor is less common than that in xxxii. 10
(= to call to witness).

in nullam : “ born to, 220. as the heir to no share of 1115 property.'’

Egerio: punning of the words eyes», eqenus. For the case see i. 3 n..

ξ 4. Lucumoni: dative of reference. It may be rendered in English
by the simple possessive genitive.

summo loco ; ablative of place, rather than origin, ‘⁶ of the noblest
position.”

ea quo innupsisset: lit. “ those things whither she had inter-
married,'’ i.e. “the state of life into which she had married.'’ A
similar translation must be adopted for his, which is the ablative of
comparison with humiliora. Quas· must be taken = ·‘ such (a woman)
as‚” in which sense the antecedent ea is usually expressed. Cp.
xxi. l n. The subjunctive innupsisset is due to attraction to the
mood of sineret.

§5. videret: the mood is due to dummodo. L. S. ξ 294; S. G.
ξ 498. Emoratum is, of course, a secondary predicate. ab Tar-
quiniis : Cicero would have omitted the preposition, but Livy not
uncommonly retains it. See L. S. ξ 117 ; S. G. ἓ 261.

ξ 6. potissimum: “the most preferable thing‚'’ im. place. The
adjective 15 used as a. complementary substantive rather than as a
direct predicate, which would, ot course, require potissima. Cp.
triste lupus ‘stabulis‘ ‘the wolf' 15 a bane to the stallsff'

in novo: some such verb as reputabat must be understood to con-
trol the oratio obliqua in this and the next 55011011. Τ1115 accounts
for the moods of sit and esset.

repentina: “recent,” ia. not a hereditary and therefore an exclu-
sive nobilit .

imagine? “bust.’' The imaqim’s· were waxen portrait-busts re-
presenting the noble ancestors of a Roman. They stood in the
vestibule of his house, and were carried publicly in his funeral pro-
cession. The more imayines he possessed, the more noble he was
deemed to be. Of course there was no such custom in the early days
at Rome, at least as Livy understands them. Ancus was the grandson
of Numa, whose bust he could therefore boast of. The title to hav-
ing one's features commemorated thus was the tenure of a curule
office.
