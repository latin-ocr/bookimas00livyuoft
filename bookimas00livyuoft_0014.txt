invented to explain facts no longer understood, as, aq„
that of Tarpeia, to account for the name of the Tarpeian
Rock (xii.), and that of the Rape of the Sabine Women,
invented to explain the Roman custom of pret-ending
to carry off a bride by force (ix.) The legends called
Euhemeristic are such as endeavour to reduce old myths to

Sabine 3 and they had a king whom they chose for life.
He was assisted by a council of old men (senes), called the
senatus, which, however, had no real power, and which he
need not obey. He was the commander of the army and the
,schief priest. The yemes met in an assembly called the Comitia
Curiata, or assembly of the wardships into which the whole
people was divided 3 and there were sacred functionaries—
pontefices, ccuyures, salii, etc. The town greW, and there
arose a large class of inhabitants who did not belong to the
