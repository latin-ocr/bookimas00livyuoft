powers, and in particular they possessed many religious
rites of their own, and so controlled the State by means
of augury, etc. The growing class of lower rank which
collected about them was the Plebs. These had no
privileges of any sort until they were enrolled in the
Comitia Centuriam. From that time they gradually as-
serted themselves, and the early history of the Republic
is the record of their struggles for independence against
the patricians.

Each patrician was in a manner a fuedal chief, with a
large retinue of retainers—his clientes, orclz'enteZa—-to whom
he acted as Patronus. There was no legal bond between
the patron and his client, but the former was expected to
look after his client’s interestS, especially in cases of law, and
the latter was in return expected to pay court to his patron,
to attend him when he went out, and to support him in any
public object he might have in view. The Patronus and
Olierntela belong, however, rather to the Republican period
than to that of the kings.

Patres and Plebs together formed the Populus, or Populus
Romanus Quiritium.

In the days of Romulus there were three tribes—the
Ramnes (or Ramnenses), Tities, and Luceres, of which the
second was said to include the Sabines of Titus Tatius.
Each of these tribes provided one Oenturia of one hundred
cavalry, who were known as Celeres. Tullus Hostilius
increased these to three centuries of 200 each, or 600
in all; Tarquinius Priscus doubled them again to 1200,
by adding three new centuries of 600 in all; so that there
were now six centuries, known as the Sex quffraqia, or Six
Votes, from their importance as voters in the Comitia
Centuriam. Livy, however, contradicts himself, and says,
in another place, that there were 1‚800 equites in all, and
it is impossible to arrive at the truth. They were com-
manded by a Master of the Horse (Tribunus Celerum,
Maqister Equitum).

The remainder of the populus formed the infantry of the
comitia centuriata—that is, the assembly of the centuries.
This was a classification of the entire people for military
purposes, according to the scale of their property, and was
