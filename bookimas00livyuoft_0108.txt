nec ultra : ‘⁴ nor did they seem likely to put up any longer (ultra,
adverb) with any one but a king, and what is more, a king chosen
by themselves.’'

auctores fierent : “the matter should be ratified (become law) on
condition that the Senate gave its sanction.” Auctor fieri is to
become a supporter or advocate of a thing, and by the Roman con-
stitution no motion which was carried in the Comitia Centuriam
(for which see below, ch. 43) became law until it had been approved
also by the patrician members of the Senate, who thus acted like
the House of Lords in the English Parliament. The sanction ot*
the Senate was termed auctoritas patrum. It lasted right through
the republic. (N.B. The procedure in the Comitia Tributa, or
plebeian assembly proper, was at first dependent on the Senatorial
sanction, but its powers grew up at a later time, and were finally
publicly recognized by the Lex Hortensia of 287 B.C., when its
decrees became law even without the sanction of the Senate.)

rogandis: “proposing.'’ This meaning arose from the phrase
“raquo-e populum‚” to “ask the people” whether they would have

be so far a mere form that it was passed beforehand, while the result

qui . . . numeretur: L. S.§ 2853 S. G.§ 480. crearitis : (= orea-
veritis)‚ future perfect indic„ the regular tense of the protasis of a
hypothetical sentence referring to future time, when the action of
the protasis is anterior to that of the apodosis. The English idiom,
which uses the simple future in both parts of the sentence, is less
logical than the Latin.

victi: “ surpassed.”

qui . . . regnaret: consecutive after relative with indefinite ante-
cedent. If it were an indirect question (“ choose who should reign at
