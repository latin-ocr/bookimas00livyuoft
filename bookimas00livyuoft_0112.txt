108 LIVY 1.

word for ‘¹ attending to ” sacred matters is procuro, not. the uncom-
pounded verb. Cp. xxi. l.

auguriis: see vi. 4, note on templa. The Augure formed the
second Sacred College, and were originally three, one from each of
the Romulean tribes. Later there were as many as sixteen. Their
duty was to decide whether the gods favoured any undertaking or
no, whether public or private. They derived most of their methods
from the Etruscans.

ch. 21. ξ 1. occupati : here in the less common sense of “ busied ’‘
(xiv. 4).

ea . . . ut: “such . . . that‚” a common substitute for talis ut.
So is . . . qm' .· cp. below, ξ 2, eam . . . ut.

proximo : “with a fear next to that of the laws and their penalties.’'
In full the sentence would be metu promimo metum lequm. Proximus
with an accusative occurs, though not in Cicero.

ξ 2. tum z “ thereupon.'’

ducerent nefas ι “ deemed it a sin that the State‚'' etc.

ξ 3. quod essent z “ because there (he said) were,'’ etc. The mood
is due to virtual oratio obliqua. Hence the distinction between
quod, quia, etc„ with subjunctive and indicative, the former being
the alleqed cause, the second the real one.

ξ 5. Argeos: a number of small chapels, at one time the central
points of various rural communities in and near the Seven Hills of
Rome.

§6. deinceps : “one after the other.’' ille. . . . hic: “the former,
. . . the latter.” Cp. xiii. 2. alius . . . alia: for alter . . . altera.
So xxv. 5.

ch. 22. ξ l. pugna : see ch. xii.

populus iussit, etc. : cp. xvii. 9.

§2 proximo: Roby sums up the prose constructions of. similis
and dissimilis as follows: “When the object is a god, man, or beast,
Cicero and his age, with comparatively few exceptions, use the
genitive3 when the object is a thing, the genitive and dative indis-
criminately. Livy and later writers use the dative quite as often of
both. The persona] pronoun is always in the genitive.’'

ferocior ε “ more warlike.”

senescere : “growing weak as an old man.”

ξ 4. Albae: L. S. 43; S. G. ξ 291, 16.

sub : with the accusative this preposition frequently means “close
to‚‘' “just about.” Cp. sub qam cantum, about cock-crow.

ne quid: ele. to lose no time in coming to business.

pie: “with a fair excuse‚” “dutifully.” Pietas signifies (l) the
duty of children to parents; (2) that of men to the gods. The
infinitives depend on some such verb as putabat, understood from
sciehat.

ξ 5. in tricesimum : cp. on xv. 5.

§6. purgando: “in excusing themselves,’' ‘⁴ pleading in excuse
