maiora rerum initia: “ greater beginnings of things‚'‘ for maiorum

ad. Laurentem: ad when joined to names of localities signifies
“towards ’' or ‘⁴ near to.” Simple “ t0,'’ if requiring a preposition at
all (see L. S. ξ 112‚f0ll. ; S. G. ξ 259), is expressed by in.

tenuisse ε sc. cursum. So in English, ‘⁶ He held on (his course) to

time of the event related. Upon audierit depend the two following
clauses, down to quaerere.
