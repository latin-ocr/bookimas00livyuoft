from sollus (Gk. ὅλος) = totus and annus, properly signifies ‘⁴ recur-
ring every year,'’ and so “customary.'’ In classical Latin it never

cum defendisset z the oum is causal, and explains why they did not

capture Romulus as well as Remus.

who were the real offenders, were scarcely justified in accusing
Remus, who was an honest man.

§4. crimini: the dative ot result. L. S. ξ 144 ; S. G. ξ 297, obs.
