INTRODUCTION. 9

period as ancient as the kings, for writing, if used at all,
was only used very sparingly. There remained, then, only
tradition to fill in the details of the years previous to 390 B.c.
Tradition was copious, but utterly inconsistent. Scarcely
two writers agree on any but the most sallent points. Livy
did not take the trouble to examine the credibility of the
legends. He chose what he thought most interesting, and
avoided all discussion 3 but even thus he falls into incon-
sistencies and impossibilities, as, for instance, when he
prefers the account that Tarquin the Arrogant was the son,
and not the grandson, of Tarquinius Priscus, in which case
he must have been about seventy years of age when he threw
Servius down the steps of the Senate-house, and seized the
kingdom.

There were a few pieces of evidence, properly so called,
wherewith to eke out the legende. Amongst these were—

(i.) TreatieS‚ and (ii.) Laws, engraved on bronze and stone.
But these were so archaic that even Cicero, who lived
earlier than Livy, could scarcely read them.

For the years following the Gallie invasion Livy could
use—

(iii.) The Fasti, or Lists of Magistrates, year by year,
which went back to a very early period.

(iv.) The Annales Maximi, a yearly record of certain points
such as market prices and astronomica] events, which was
kept by the Pontvffeae Maaeimus ,· and similar meagre records
kept by the censors, augum, and other public magistrates.

(v.) The private records of the various great houses and
yentes ,· funeral orations recording the deeds of the dead,
poems, ete.

(vi.) Earlier Histories‚ all compiled in much the same way
as Livy’s, and only really valuable when the writer was an
eye-witness Such histories were those of·—

(a) L. Calpurnius Piso (see Index).
(b) M. Porcius cato, who flourished about 200 B.c., and wrote the

history of certain periods.
(0) L. Cincius Alimentus‚·about the same date, who wrote in Greek.

(d) Q. Fabius Pictor (see Index).

The great mass of legends which filled up the earlier
period arose from two causes, called (a) Aetiological, and (b)
